# Decision_Tree_Final

Recreating the Decision Tree is very simple. You first would need to download the NED-D dataset. [https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/Library/Distances/]

The file Decision_Tree.ipynb will process and build the decision tree in two ways.
  The first Decision Tree is built including dates of measurement.
  The second Decision Tree omits the measurements dates, this results in slightly worse accuracy (very minimal).

Credit given to ChatGPT for assisting in creating the functions to build the Decision Tree. [https://chatgpt.com/share/6816d11c-ce24-8013-b57d-b6a4eec22488]
